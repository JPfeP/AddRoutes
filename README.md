If you want to participate to the development, theses sources files need some additionnal libraries to function properly (mostly rtmidi and oscpy), consequently you have to install them on your system :


    Python-RTMIDI: http://trac.chrisarndt.de/code/wiki/python-rtmidi
    MIDO : https://github.com/mido/mido
    OSCPY: https://github.com/kivy/oscpy
